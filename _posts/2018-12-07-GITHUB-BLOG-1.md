  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Yes, I was able to persevere with refining and making my system more sleek.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I do not think that I questioned enough, however if I needed help then I would ask my peers if they had any idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Yes, as I was able to make a great deal of the spreadsheet converter myself and refine it into a simpler system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Not really. I did encounter problems and had to learn how to fix it, however.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I could've been a lot more engaged.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well, I could have increased the speed at which I worked. This could have been a factor or the fact that I could have worked a lot harder and make the UI a lot finer, so it was a let down in that respect. All in all, I think that it went well.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have improved the fact that I was unable to focus at some parts, as I was helping other people a lot more than myself, assisting them with their spreadsheet and such.
I could also change my focus on learning, as that needed a lot more work than it was designated.</td>
