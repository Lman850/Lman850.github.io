    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I was able to continue with most games, despite some of them being tedious, so I was persevering in order to have a better experience through my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I did not have many questions for this lesson in all honesty.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Yes, I was able to independently select some tasks for myself using the website hour of code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I was reflecting on some of the things I had learnt through the lesson using my knowledge gained prior to some of the tasks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I worked with a partner during the lesson to have a better time on some of the multiplayer games on the website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have spent a lot more time learning instead of just playing the lot more simpler games that are on the website that we used. I also could have payed more attention to some of the tasks that the games gave me, despite some of them being quite simple. I also could have made sure that I gave myself a challenge on most of the games, though some of them were quite amateur for my learning, and as such I did not learn as much as I would have should I challenged myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to give myself a bit more of a challenge in order to further my experiences in my own work, though the lesson itself was meant to be quite a chill one by standards, as it was one of the last days of school itself.
All in all, I think that not many changes needed to be made to the learning that we were tasked with, as it was a fun lesson and we enjoyed it.</td>
