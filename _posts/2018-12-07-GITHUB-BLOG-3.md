  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Yes. I persevered in codecademy at the start in order to learn how to use a for loop, as I am not too 100% on how they work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes, I was able to question on how certain processes work, like loops that work like while: X is true, do:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I believe that I was independent to an extent, as I have tried my best to learn myself at the start on codecademy and I helped myself learn.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I was able to reflect on how I could do some certain things within the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I think that I was able to push myself into the classroom learning as needed, so engagement is fine by my standards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could've gone better was the fact that I was faltering in my ability to start my work on codecademy at the start of the lesson, which disadvantaged me, but I was able to finally learn how to run some certain processes, I.E. Loops, so that came in handy by the end.
Should I have focuses a bit more towards the beginning, I could have concentrated a lot more than I was doing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to concentrate a lot more in order to fully further my learning when I am using online resources such as Codecademy. This would allow me to interact a lot more in class learning as well, such as giving inputs when the teacher asks questions to the class.</td>
